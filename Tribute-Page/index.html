            <span class="first-letter">E</span>dmond Albius was born into a family of slaves in Sainte-Suzanne, Reunion Island, in 1829. Orphaned at an early age, he was entrusted to the care of F√©rr√©ol Bellier-Beaumont, a man with a passion for botany. Albius grew up in this household, assigned to domestic chores, but his interest in plants manifested itself early on.

            <span class="first-letter">A</span>round 1839-1840, when he was just ten years old, Edmond carefully observed his master working on vanilla cultivation. At the time, the pollination of this orchid remained a mystery: without the Mexican Melipona bee, the plant would produce no fruit outside its natural habitat.

        </div>

        <div class="left">
          <p>
            <span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1841, aged just 12, Edmond Albius discovered a simple and effective method for pollinating vanilla by hand. Using a thin rod and his thumb, he succeeded in reproducing the contact between the male and female organs of the flower. It was a revolutionary discovery, one that enabled the island to become one of the world's leading vanilla producers.

          <p>
            <span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1848, the abolition of slavery was finally proclaimed on Reunion Island. Edmond became a free man at the age of 19. However, despite his major contribution to the island's economy, he received no reward, official recognition or financial compensation.

          <p>
            <span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1852, Edmond Albius was falsely accused of theft and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. His former master intervened on his behalf with the governor, reminding him of his precious invention. Thanks to this letter, the sentence was reduced, and Edmond was released after about two years.

            <span class="first-letter">O</span>n his release, he tries to rebuild his life as best he can. He found a modest job as a kitchen assistant at the hospital in Sainte-Suzanne, where he worked in the shadows, living in poverty and oblivion.

            <span class="first-letter">E</span>dmond Albius died in 1880 in Sainte-Suzanne, aged 51. A tragic irony: he died without glory, while vanilla had become a flourishing industry worldwide, largely thanks to him.

Today, his story is taught, his name appears on street signs, a school is dedicated to him, and statues pay tribute to him. He is now recognized as a symbol of historical justice, resilience and forgotten genius.
